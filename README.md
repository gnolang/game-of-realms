# Game of Realms: Joining the Notable Contributor Ecosystem

The worldwide competition to find the best contributors to gno.land is happening now. At the current development stage of the project, we are targeting more advanced developers given the needs to develop the code base, and expand the available tools to address future contributor profiles. 

We anticipate that once the necessary tools are available, weâ€™ll expand the notable contribution competition to newer devs and non-technical contributors.

If you want to play a key role in the success of gno.land and web3, and become a notable contributor in our ecosystem, joining the Game of Realms is a great way to get stated. We recommend you identify where you can make the biggest impact, and open a [PR](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/). You can document your contributions profile in the Hackerspace repository that will be considered upon review over time to qualify for inclusion in the notable contribution folder and identified as a Game of Realms contributor. 


We will be building out the structure of this Readme to help support you in our contributor Game of Realms journey.
