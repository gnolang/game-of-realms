# Game of Realms

[Go Here!](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/390)

The worldwide competition to find the best contributors to Gno.land is currently in phase one – for advanced developers only.

Once the necessary tools to start phase two are ready, we’ll open up the competition to newer devs and non-technical contributors.

If you want to stack ATOM rewards and play a key role in the success of Gno.land and web3, read more about Game of Realms or open a [PR](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/) today.
