# Manfred Touron (moul)

## who i am  
i’m manfred touron, an open-source contributor, builder, and decentralization advocate. i’ve been involved in various web3, infrastructure, and open-source projects, always pushing for more transparent, resilient, and community-driven technology.

## why i’m here  
gno represents everything I believe in: openness, decentralization, and contribution-driven ecosystems. i want to help make it the best platform for decentralized applications—not just in technology, but in governance, community, and long-term impact.
with years of experience building decentralized infrastructure, i see gno as a rare opportunity to get it right, and i’m here to contribute however i can.

## how i contribute  
as a co-founder, my role is simple: chief of getting shit done. that means doing whatever needs to be done—whether it’s high-level strategy, coordination, hiring, managing, or jumping in to fix things myself. my contributions to gno include:
- setting direction and making sure things actually happen
- reviewing, contributing to, and shaping the ecosystem
- prototyping, breaking, and refining core ideas
- making sure the right people are in the right place to make things move
- advising on governance and coordination mechanisms
- improving developer experience and tooling
- supporting and mentoring contributors

## involvement & ethics  
i advise other web3 projects and will soon disclose them in a privacy-preserving way. in the meantime, i pledge to always prioritize gno’s best interests.
