Welcome to my (manual) Gno resume. This is a demo intended for any Gno contributor to present themselves similarly.

We are planning to create an off-chain equivalent of the upcoming on-chain Proof of Contribution and Review DAO. This will involve incorporating both scripts and manual entries.

I will soon create two additional files for contributors:
1. `github-contributions.md`: This file will be generated by a bot created by Michael and Jon. It will update the file with new "merged PRs" along with relevant metrics. The process will be fully automated and should not be associated with an automatic scoring system. Instead, it will provide metrics that will assist reviewers.
2. `mad-props.md`: This file can be accessed by leaders/maintainers/facilitators of components/subcomponents. They can use it to attribute official "mad props" that are considered relatively trustworthy because they are made by leaders in public and with transparency.

In the future, we expect most of these things to be on-chain with vote systems, etc. However, for now, let's focus on off-chain activities and explore both manual and bot-assisted approaches.
